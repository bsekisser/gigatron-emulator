# gigatron-emulator
An emulator meant for the gigatron TTL micrcomputer
Only tested on Linux

To build this program run: "make".

In order to run the program in linux you enter the command "./emulate Romv3.rom"
It is essential to point to a rom when booting up the program.
I recomend to put the rom-file in this folder.

here are the required packages:
libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-dbg libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libsdl2-image-dbg libsdl2-image-dev
